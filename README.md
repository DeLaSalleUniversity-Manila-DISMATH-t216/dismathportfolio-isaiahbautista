##WEEK 1

➤ Orientation about the course DISMATH (Discrete Mathematics)

➤ Introduction of some applications of Dismath in certain word problems

Ex. Knights and Knaves

  
➤ Introduction to Logical Operations

Logical Symbol	Logical Operator	Shorthand	Logical Expression

¬	Negation	not	¬p

∧	Conjunction	and	p ∧ q

v	Disjunction	or	p v q

⊕	Exclusive Disjunction	xor	p ⊕ q

→	Conditional	if, then	p → q

↔	Biconditional	iff	p ↔ q


➤ Propositional Logic: (p → q)

∙ is the area of logic dealing with propositions.

   ✓ Inverse: ¬p → ¬q

   ✓ Converse: q → p

   ✓ Contraposition: ¬q → ¬p 
   
   
##WEEK 2

➤ Logical Equivalences helps in simplification of logical statments
I have yet to memorize ALL of these. 
Here are some of the logical euivalences:

∙ Identity Law
    ✓ p ∧ T ≡ p

    ✓ p ∧ F ≡ p

∙ Domination Law

    ✓ p v T ≡ T  

    ✓ p ∧ F ≡ F 

∙ Idempotent Law

    ✓ p v p ≡ p 

    ✓ p ∧ p ≡ p 

∙ Double Negation Law

    ✓ ¬(¬p)≡ p 


∙ Commutative Law

    ✓ p v q ≡ q v p

    ✓ p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p 

∙ Associative Law

    ✓ (p v q) v r ≡ p v (q v r) 

    ✓ (p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)

∙ Distributive Law

    ✓ p v (q v r) ≡ (p v q) v (p v r)

    ✓ p ∧ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∧ (p ∧ r) 

∙ De Morgan's Law

    ✓ ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q

    ✓ ¬(p v q) ≡ ¬p v ¬q 

∙ Absorption Law

    ✓ p v (p ∧ q) ≡ p 

    ✓ p ∧ (p v q)≡ p 

∙ Negation Law

    ✓ p v ¬p ≡ T

    ✓ p ∧ ¬p ≡ F 
    
➤ Rules of Interference are used to test the validity of arguments.


Modus ponens	p, p→q ∴q

Modus tollens	¬q, p→q ∴ ¬p

Hypothetical syllogism	p → q, q → r ∴p → r

Disjunctive syllogism	p ∨ q, ¬p ∴q

Addition	p ∴p ∨ q

Simplication	p ∧ q ∴p

Conjunction	p, q ∴p ∧ q

Resolution	p ∨ q, ¬p ∨ r ∴q ∨ r

➤ Quantifiers

• Universal Quantifier

  - "for all"

  - Symbol: ∀(x)

• Existential Quantifier

  - "there exist"

  - Symbol: ∃(x)
   
  
##WEEK 3

➤ Introduction to Methods of Proof

∙ Direct Proof:

   First Step: Assume that "p" is TRUE

   Second Step: Show that "q" is also TRUE

∙ Indirect Proof:

    First Step: Assume that "¬q" is TRUE

    Second Step: Show that "¬p" is also TRUE

∙ Proof by Contradiction:

    First Step: Assume that the "antecedent" is FALSE

    Second Step: Using an assumption and other facts show that it is a contradiction

∙ Proof by Contraposition:

    First Step: Assume that the "premise" is FALSE

    Second Step: Using an assumption and other facts show that it is a contraposition
    
    
##WEEK 4

➤ Mathematical Induction


  - It is a form of direct proof, and it is done in two steps. 
  
1st step: Basic Step
-prove the statement by substituting a value and see if the statement holds true. 

  
  
2nd step: Inductive step
-prove that the statement is true for all possible values by using any of the kinds of proof. 
  
  
  
➤ Summation

  - Symbol: ∑
  - addition of a sequence of numbers


➤ Recursive/Inductive

  - Repeated application of functions in order to solve a function. 

  Steps:

  1.Basic Step

      - Specify the value of a given as a function at F(0) 

  2. Recursive Step
      - create a statement that makee the function true for any value substituted to it. 

##WEEK 5

Program Correctness

Steps:

  1 Partial correctness

      - initial assertion(input)

      - final assertion (output)

  2. Show that the program terminates correctly
    Hoare Triple: p{S}q

     given:

        p = initial assertion

       {S} = program segment

        q = final assertion

      Steps:

        1. Assume tha p is TRUE

        2. Substitute to the program {S}, showing that q is TRUE
        
 Power Series

  -Example: Zeno's Paradox

   Can be solved using GEOMETRIC SERIES formula:

    a1/ 1-r
    
  Introduction to set theory

  Set-  an unordered collection of objects

  a. Set Difference
      (A-B) or (A/B)

  b. Set Intersection
        A△B

  Power Set- a set containing all subsets
  
  ##Week 6
  
  Cardinality- total number of distinct elements
  
  No- pronounced as "aleph zero"/"aleph-null"
  
  Had a review about nested quantifiers
  - a for loop within another for loop
  
  Functions

  Types:
  1. One to one function
    - each domain is assigned to a certain co-domain
    - no common co-domain
  2. Onto Function
    -each co-domain is assigned to a domain.
    - no co-domain is left without a partner. 
    
##Week 7
-no classes

##Week 8

➤ Algorithm

- is a finite set of precise instruction

    Precondition- describes the input

   Postcondition- describes what the output should satisfy

    ✓ Properties:

       • Input

       • Output

       • Definiteness

       • Correctness

       • Finiteness

       • Generality
